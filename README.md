# Overview

This is a coding kata, or 'practice', to better understand how to do *Test Driven Development*.

Code Katas are a great way for individuals and teams to sharpen their skills. You can find more katas to practice on [Code Kata](http://codekata.com/) and [KataCoda](https://www.katacoda.com/).

# FizzBuzz

The "Fizz-Buzz" is an interview question designed to help understand how candidates approach problem solving. The question generally goes like this:

> "Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”."

If you would like to read an **extremely hot** take on this, see [Why Can't Programmers...Program?](https://blog.codinghorror.com/why-cant-programmers-program/).

We are going to do a slightly simpler variation, skipping the 1-to-100 loop.
